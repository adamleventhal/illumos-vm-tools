Solaris driver for VMware para-virtualized SCSI HBA.

NOTES:

1. Currently driver builds as a standalone module.
2. Since vmw_pvscsi.h has not yet been ported from Linux to be a
   CDDL-compliant, driver builds with errors (i.e. doesn't build),
   unless the header is not copied from Linux to the driver's directory (pvscsi).
